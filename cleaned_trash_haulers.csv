I HAVE TO MOVE GARBAGE CANS IN MY ALLEY JUST SO I CAN GET OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND NOT HIT 6 CANS.
I HAVE REQUESTED IN THE PAST THAT THE GARBAGE CANS BE RETURNED TO AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND THE LIDS CLOSED! LEAVING THE LIDS OPEN ALLOWS FOR MOSQUITOES TO BREED FREELY AND ENCOURAGES RODENTS. 
IF THE CANS WERE RETURNED TO THEIR UPRIGHT POSITION AND CLOSED, THIS WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE COST OF MAINTAINING THE CANS AND THE SERVICE. IT WOULD ALSO HELP MITIGATE OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO MOSQUITO AND RODENT CONTROL.
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN JUST IN MY ALLEY. I NOTICE IT IN ALMOST EVERY ALLEY WHEN WALKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

78081,2018-06-26,Trash Collection Complaint,"THIS IS MY SECOND COMPLAINT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS I HAVE AT THIS ADDRESS . THE COMPLAINT WAS ORIGINALLY RESOLVED AND NOW THE ISSUE IS BACK AGAIN:

FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE TRASH MAN HAS NOT EMPTIED THE ENTIRE BIN & HAS NOT CLOSED THE LID TO THE BIN. THEY DO NOT PICK UP THE BIN AND DUMP IT, INSTEAD, THEY OPEN THE LID AND PULL BAGS OUT AND THEN LEAVE WITH THE LID OPEN.

FOR MONTHS, THIS TRASH BAG AND HOUSE VENT HAVE BEEN IN MY TRASH BIN. PEOPLE WHO WALK THE ALLEYS THROW THEIR TRASH (BOTTLES, ETC.) IN BINS (AS YOU CAN SEE VIA THE IMAGE). THEY ALSO THROW THEIR DOG BAGS OF FECES. THEN, WHEN IT RAINS, BECAUSE THE LID WAS LEFT WIDE OPEN, IT COLLECTS WATER. THE WATER MIXES WITH THE FECES AND IT BECOMES A BREEDING GROUND FOR INSECTS, ESPECIALLY MISQUOTES. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.  IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE TRASH MAN DOES NOT (1) DUMP THE ENTIRE BIN NOR (2) CLOSE THE LID. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT MY BIN IS DUMPED IN FULL FOR TOMORROW'S PICK-UP. THE BIN HAS BECOME DISGUSTING. I USED TO CLEAN IT MYSELF THE FIRST YEAR; HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.

SINCERELY,

WE PRAY FOR RAIN TO WASH THE STENCH AND ""STAINS"" ON THE STREET AFTER EACH TRASH PICKUP. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE VILE LIQUID. LAST WEDNESDAY, THE TRASH TRUCK ALSO DROPPED SOLIDS AS IT TRAVELED DOWN MY STREET. THOSE SOLIDS GET EATEN BY WILD ANIMALS, BUT ARE ALSO EATEN BY HOUSEHOLD PETS (DOGS, CATS, ETC.). I'M HOPING MY DOG DOESN'T GET SICK AS A RESULT. LAST WEDNESDAY, THE TRASH TRUCK ALSO DROPPED BROKEN GLASS AS IT TRAVELED DOWN THE STREET. I'VE PICKED UP BETWEEN 50 AND 100 PIECES AS I WALKED MY DOG, AND I STILL SEE PIECES ON THE GROUND DAYS LATER. THE GLASS IS SMALL ENOUGH TO GET CAUGHT IN THE PAW OF A DOG OR CAT, AND CAN CAUSE INJURY. 
WHY CAN'T THE TRUCKS BE ""SEALED"" SO THEY DON'T DISCHARGE THE VILE LIQUID, SOLIDS OR BROKEN GLASS? MY NEIGHBORS AND I WANT OUR TRASH PICKED UP, BUT WE DON'T APPRECIATE THE UNNECESSARY SIDE EFFECTS.

I JUST TRIED CALLING BUT YOUR PHONE LINES ARE CLOSED AFTER 5PM.

I DON'T KNOW WHY LAST WEEK'S REQUEST WAS CLOSED.  MY TRASH WAS NEVER PICKED UP ""WITHIN 1-3 BUSINESS DAYS"" FROM LAST WED.  I LEFT MY TRASH BIN OUT ALL WEEK FOR IT TO BE PICKED UP, BUT IT STILL WASN'T.
 I RECEIVED THIS EMAIL MESSAGE ON MONDAY (ABOUT MY PREVIOUS REQUEST BEING CLOSED, HOWEVER I FIGURED IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE TRASH PICKUP WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TWO DAYS AGAIN, MEANING TODAY, WEDNESDAY.  BUT THAT WAS NOT TO BE SO!  I JUST ARRIVED HOME FROM WORK AND MY TRASH HAS NOT BEEN PICKED UP... AGAIN!  THIS IS THE THIRD WEEK IN A ROW THAT TRASH ALONG OUR ALLEYWAY HAS NOT BEEN PICKED UP!  I ONLY REPORTED IT FOR LAST WEEK'S NON-PICKUP. 

ATTACHED ARE TWO PHOTOS I TOOK JUST MINUTES AGO (AT 6:25 PM WED 9/19/18) OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE TRASH BINS HAVE NOT BEEN PICKED UP.  THE FIRST PIC IS THAT OF MY NEIGHBORS, SHOWING THEIR TRASH BINS OVERFLOWING.  THE SECOND PIC IS OF MY TRASH BIN WITH SEVERAL BAGS IN IT.  

MY ADDRESS IS 310 - 37TH AVE N, NASHVILLE TN 37209 IN SYLVAN HEIGHTS.  THE TRASH BINS ARE LOCATED IN THE ALLEY IMMEDIATELY EAST OF 37TH AVE AND WEST OF 35TH AVE, BETWEEN ELKINS AND NEVADA AVENUES.  WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET OUR TRASH BINS EMPTIED, PLEASE?  ARE YOU SHORT HANDED FOR WORKERS?  THE GARBAGE MEN WE HAD BEFORE WERE REALLY GOOD, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS NOW.

PLEASE DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO GET THESE TRASH BINS EMPTIED IN A TIMELY MANNER, AS IT'S MAKING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD LOOK TRASHY.

THANK YOU!

THE TRASH SERVICE CAME ON 11/20/18 AT AROUND 430PM, USUALLY THEY COME IN THE MID MORNING. THEY PICKED OUR TRASH CAN  UP WITH THE TRUCK AND AS IT WAS COMING DOWN THEY DROP A BAG IN THE STREET. I AM ASSUMING THEY WERE NOT AWARE THE BAG FELL AND ROLLED OVER THE BAG OF TRASH. AT THIS POINT,  I CAME OUTSIDE WHEN THE BAG OF TRASH WAS DROPPED, AND THEY BACKED UP AND PICKED THE BAG OF TRASH UP. THE GUY THAT GOT OUT OF THE PASSENGER SEAT SEEMED VERY UPSET THAT THE TRASH DROPPED AND GOT OUT AND THREW THE TRASH IN THE TRASH CAN LEAVING TRASH IN THE STREET. I ASKED THE GUY THAT GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK WAS HE JUST GOING TO LEAVE THE TRASH THERE, I THOUGHT HE DID NOT HEAR ME SO I SAID EXCUSE ME TWICE AND HE COMPLETELY IGNORED ME AND GOT BACK IN HIS TRUCK.  THEY PICKED THE TRASH CAN UP AGAIN AND EMPTIED IT FROM THE BAG THAT WAS DROPPED IN THE STREET. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY DROP TRASH ON OUR STREET AND DON'T PICK IT UP, IT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN. I WORK FROM HOME AND I AM ABLE TO SEE THEM DROP TRASH OFTEN. ONLY THIS TIME, I ACTUALLY HAD MY PHONE READY TO RECORD A VIDEO OF THEM DROPPING THE BAG OF TRASH ( I WAS UNABLE TO UPLOAD THE VIDEO, BUT IF I NEED TO... I WILL COME THERE TO SHOW YOU THE VIDEO).

THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE LIST OF THINGS NOT TO BE INCLUDED (LEAVES, DEBRIS, ETC.).  THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS A FURNACE FILTER THAT IS CARDBOARD BUT THE INTERIOR IS METAL THAT I DON'T THINK IS SUPPOSED TO GO IN RECYCLE.  THERE WAS A CHICKFILET BAG CONTAINING THE GARBAGE FROM A MEAL.  IT WAS BASICALLY GARBAGE.  I ALSO HAD A NOTE ON ON MY RECYCLE.  THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE IS WE DID BAG THE PAPER FROM OUR SHREDDER IN A PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG.  

I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIST OF ACCEPTABLE AND NOT AND THINK WE ARE ABIDING, BUT EVIDENTLY SOMEONE THINKS DIFFERENTLY THAN I.  CAN I HAVE A PLACE TO GO FOR MORE GUIDANCE OR THIS IS GOING TO BE A CONTINUAL ISSUE.

I PAY TAXES FOR THIS SERVICE AND EXPECT IT TO BE PICKED UP.

I LIVE IN A  FLASHING LIGHT SCHOOL ZONE OF MCKISSACK MIDDLE SCHOOL  AND METRO SCHOOL BUSES CAN'T TURN INTO OR EXIT 38TH AVE N WITH OUR CART LEFT IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE BUSES ARE APPROXIMATELY 45FT, (13.7M) LONG THIS IS A HAZARD FOR THE CHILD PEDESTRIANS WALKING TO AND FROM SCHOOL AS WELL AS FOR THE BUS DRIVERS. PLEASE ASK THE CREW TO REPLACE THE CART FROM WHERE THEY GOT IT (OUT OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY)? THE CREWS HAD BEEN DOING WELL FOR MONTHS (NO COMPLAINTS). ENCOURAGE THEM TO TIGHTEN UP AND DO-THE-RIGHT THING. IF THEY DON'T I'LL HAVE TO COMPLAIN EVERY WEEK AND ESCALATE THE TICKET TO UPPER MANAGEMENT. IT TAKES LESS EFFORT TO PUT THE CART AWAY THAN TO BE NEGLIGENT AND CAUSE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS OR CHILDREN RAN OVER.

MAY YOU BE HEALTHY AND SAFE!
MAY YOUR CART CREWS BE SAFE AND PROFESSIONAL.

WE CAN'T WALK OUR DOG ON TRASH DAYS BECAUSE THERE IS ALSO GLASS SPILLED AND TRASH LEFT BEHIND.

I WOULD ENJOY IF THE CREW WOULD SIMPLY RETURN THE CART TO WHERE THEY GOT IT FROM, OFF THE STREET, NOT ON THE CURB AND BEYOND THE SIDEWALK ADJACENT TO THE FIRE HYDRANT.  THIS LOCATION CLEARS THE STREET FOR SCHOOL BUSES AND THE SIDEWALK FOR PEDESTRIANS. IN ADDITION ASK THEM TO CLOSE THE LID ON THE CART.  ALL WORK IS HONORABLE AND I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THEIR EFFORTS BUT NOW THE CREW ACTS LIKE THEY DON'T DON'T PAY THE SUPERVISORS OR CITIZENS ANY ATTENTION. THEY ARE TWO FEET FROM EARNING EXCELLENT  SATISFACTION RATINGS.  INSTEAD THEY ARE EARNING EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED FEEDBACK.

WRITING IN BECAUSE I THINK THE TRUCK THAT CAME TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD MAY NEED SOME ATTENTION. AS SOON AS I TURNED ONTO 28TH AVE N. COMING HOME FROM WORK, I SMELLED TRASH LIQUID. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOCATION OF MY HOUSE, YOU CAN SEE A DRIVE THAT SEPARATES THE TWO ROWS OF HOMES. THAT'S WHERE WE PUT OUT THE CARTS ON TRASH DAY. THERE WAS A CLEAR TRAIL OF STINKY TRASH LIQUID RUNNING THE LENGTH OF THAT DRIVE WITH PUDDLES WHERE THE TRUCK MUST HAVE PAUSED. ON THOSE PUDDLES, FLIES WERE GATHERING SO THEY WERE DEFINITELY THE SOURCE OF THE SMELL. I DID MY BEST TO DILUTE AND HOSE AWAY THE PUDDLES AND TRAILS BUT I COULDN'T GET IT ALL AND I CERTAINLY COULDN'T WASH UP THE STREET. -- I DON'T KNOW MUCH AT ALL ABOUT HOW GARBAGE TRUCKS WORK BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAK GARBAGE WATER LIKE THAT.
